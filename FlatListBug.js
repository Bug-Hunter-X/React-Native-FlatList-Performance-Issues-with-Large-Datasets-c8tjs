This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and trying to render a large number of items.  The error message may vary slightly, but it will essentially indicate that React Native is struggling to handle the rendering of so many components efficiently.  It's often accompanied by performance issues such as lagging or freezing.

```javascript
// buggy code
<FlatList
  data={largeArray}
  renderItem={({item}) => <MyComponent item={item}/>}
/>
```
